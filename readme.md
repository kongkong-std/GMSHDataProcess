# Handling the msh file generated by the Gmsh script
The main purpose is to obtain mesh data for finite element program development. By 
partitioning the entity regions, node data and element data are obtained. Node data 
includes node numbers and node coordinates, while element data includes element numbers
and the node numbers contained within each element. Different identifiers are also set 
for boundary conditions.<br>
Provide some simple examples of mesh partitioning, such as triangular and 
quadrilateral mesh partitioning for a rectangular region.
